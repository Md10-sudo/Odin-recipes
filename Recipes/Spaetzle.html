    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
Spaetzle (or <em>Spätzle</em>) is a distinctive and delicious type of soft egg noodle or dumpling that originates from Swabia, a region in southwestern Germany, though variations are popular throughout Central Europe, including Austria and Hungary. Made from a simple, wet batter of flour, eggs, and often milk or water, the texture of Spaetzle is famously firm and chewy, setting it apart from thinner Italian pasta. Its name literally translates to "little sparrow," which refers to the shape they were thought to resemble when they were traditionally hand-scraped into boiling water.</p>
    <p>What makes Spaetzle unique is its irregular shape and porous surface, which is achieved by forcing the batter through a specialized perforated tool (like a Spaetzle press or plane) or a coarse colander directly into simmering water. Once cooked, the noodles float to the surface and are often sautéed in butter until lightly golden brown. Spaetzle is incredibly versatile and is perhaps best known as the base for Käsespätzle (a German-style baked mac and cheese with caramelized onions). However, it most commonly serves as a robust side dish, perfectly suited to soaking up the rich sauces and gravies from hearty German dishes like goulash, schnitzel, or sauerbraten.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon crème fraîche, sour cream, or plain yogurt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>

    <h2>How to cook</h2>
        <ol>
    <li>Whisk flour, milk, egg, crème fraîche, salt, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl until batter drips slowly off whisk. Add a bit more flour if batter seems too thin; add a bit more milk if batter seems too thick.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a simmer over medium-high heat. Push a spoonful of batter into the simmering water through the smooth side of a cheese grater with fairly large holes using a spatula.</li>
    <li>Mix in 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, and transfer the mixture to a slow cooker. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over top.</li>
    <li>Cook spätzle in batches until they rise to water's surface, about 3 minutes. Remove spätzle with a slotted spoon. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
