    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made of layers of thin, flat pasta sheets, alternating with rich fillings, and topped with cheese, typically baked until bubbly and golden. The foundations of a traditional lasagna are the ragù (a slow-cooked meat sauce, often including beef and pork), a creamy white sauce like béchamel or ricotta cheese, and plenty of Parmesan or mozzarella cheese.</p>
    <p>This hearty casserole originated in Italy and has become a beloved comfort food worldwide, adaptable to many regional variations that might include different meats, vegetables, or cheeses. The preparation involves arranging the cooked or oven-ready pasta sheets and spreading the sauces and fillings in a repeating pattern within a deep baking dish. The final layer is usually smothered in cheese to create a crisp, golden crust. Because it combines multiple flavors and textures—the tenderness of the pasta, the savory depth of the meat sauce, and the meltiness of the cheese—lasagna is an ideal dish for feeding a crowd and is often served as a centerpiece for family gatherings or celebratory meals.</p>
